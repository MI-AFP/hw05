# MI-AFP homework #05

Homework to practice advanced work with functions and basics of typeclasses

## Task

1. 

Hints & general requirements: 

* Being [DRY](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is essential, do not repeat code. Name expressions to reuse then, introduce helper functions.
* Local names (via `where` or `let-in`) in functions should be introduced to make the code more readable. Creating helper functions in module scope is **awful**.
* Make your code as clean as possible. Prefer pattern matching and syntactic sugar everywhere it is reasonable.
* You must understand your code completely!

## Notes 

 * In case of uncertainty, check the [dummy homework](https://github.com/MI-AFP/hw00) to recall what is the homework workflow for this course.
 * If you encounter some trouble, create an issue in your repository.
 * In case you find a bug or have an idea how to improve assignment project, create an issue or PR in this repository.
